### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yura Kolesnikov, nice to meet you!

:black_heart: My passion is to develop high-performance, modern Android-applications with UX well designed .

I've learned development by myself. <br>
And I'm **proud of results I've reached** :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

:computer: Now I'm working at my first IT-job.

I'm not the person who stops at some level. "Always grow up" is my principle. :top: <br>
Whether it developing, music making or skiing!
