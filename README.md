### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yura Kolesnikov, nice to meet you!

:black_heart: My passion is to develop high-performance, modern Android-applications with UX well designed .

I have a feature: there's no professional developing education in my brains. 
All my experience is 1 year of self-education. <br>
And I'm **proud of results I've reached** :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

:earth_americas: Thanks the universe, all programming materials are free in the Internet nowadays.

I'm not the person who stops at some level. "Always grow up" is my principle. :top: <br>
Whether it developing, music making or skiing! 

I feel **ready** for the first job as a developer.  Try me! :muscle:
